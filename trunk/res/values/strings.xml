This is an early beta release of SwiFTP that lacks some features, so please be patient.\n\n\
\
Once you have started the server, you may access it with the username \"anonymous\" and \
any password. Your FTP client must use PASV mode.\n\n\
\
Look in the /sdcard directory for your music and other files.\n\n\
\
Wifi must be enabled before the server will start. This version of SwiFTP doesn't use the \
3G network.\n\n\
\
For security reasons, it's recommended that the server be stopped after use.\n\n\
Full instructions are on the wiki at http://www.swiftp.org/.\n\n\
\
Don't be alarmed by messages about ignored or unrecognized commands, these are normal as \
long as they don't cause undesired behavior.\n\n\
\
Thanks for using SwiFTP, and look for fixes and improvements soon.\n\
