Thanks for using SwiFTP! Here are some brief usage instructions. More information can be \
found at http://www.swiftp.org.\n\n\
\
You should have been prompted to enter a username and password when you started SwiFTP \
for the first time. You must use this username and password when accessing the server. \
This information can be changed later by clicking the Setup button from the main screen.\
\n\n\
\
Look in the /sdcard directory for your music and other files.\n\n\
\
SwiFTP allows you to enable and disable wifi from the main control screen. However, this \
only works if you are using a network that you have connected to before.\n\n\
\
For power and security reasons, it's recommended that the server be stopped after use.\n\n\
\
If you're watching the server log, don't be alarmed by messages about ignored or unrecognized commands, these are normal as \
long as they don't cause undesired behavior.\n\n\
\
SwiFTP is open source, and help with graphic design and non-English translation are badly needed (look \
at that awful icon)! \n\n\
\
If something is not working the way you expect it to, please report it to me at www.swiftp.org.\n\n\
\
Thanks for using SwiFTP, and look for more improvements soon.\n\n\

<string name="error_dialog_text">\
SwiFTP has encountered the following error: \n\
\n\
<b>%%%Replace_Here%%%</b>\n\
\n\
If you think that this error should not have occurred, it would be very helpful if you \
would email <b>swiftp-devel @ googlegroups.com</b> or visit <b>http://www.swiftp.org</b> 
and report this as a bug (go to the <b>"Issues"</b> \
section).\n\
\n\
Thanks very much for your help!\n\
